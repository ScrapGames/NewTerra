*OpenSource release of NewTerra*

# What Is NewTerra?
**NewTerra** is a relaxing resource gathering and building game set on planets and moons in various solar systems.  Your goal as the mission drone is to save humanity from the extinction event on earth by terraforming planets and colonizing planets along the way.
A fully fleshed out [Game Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYWqWIF6ULXIiZC99v4d6BNCfC1VkDRlUcD5BAccXhU/edit?usp=sharing) has been created showing the games vision.  (*Feel free to comment and add to it!*)

# Why is it now public?
After applying for several grants to help fund the game and receiving no positive feedback, I decided it was time to step away from my career in game development and shift into other verticals.
I still believe the game vision is fun and is something I would want to play - however the lack of financial support from my local government and almost zero industry opportunity in my area has forced my hand.
There are some great coding examples and practices here - so if anything it is a good reference to have up publicly.

# I love this! Can I help?
As mentioned above, I still believe in this game and I will continue to work on it at a hobbiest capacity.  That said, I welcome contributers and if other people out there want to help the future of the game - that would be amazing!  
If this happens and the game gets completed - it will be released as free however similar to what Dauntless has done, credit people and show their contributions in the main menu and have a link for direct donations to those people :)

# What do I need to know after I download it?
**THE BIGGEST THING TO NOTE** The game loads required assets asynchronously via a *bootstrap* scene.
If you want to play the game in the editor to check it out, you *must* load up the scene called **bootstrap** for it to work correctly.
The game supports both mouse/keyboard and controller - however the UI is not optimised for the controller as yet.
